Hi guys,
I'm a teacher, currently converting to working with coding. I haven't decided if I wanted to pursue data science, or coding; I find it more interesting to analyze the data, than to create. Then again, I guess that's because I'm not all that creative. I'm hoping to pursue a career in tech and make better money.
